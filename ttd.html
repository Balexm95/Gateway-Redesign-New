              The Space Needle is an observation tower in Seattle, Washington, United States. Located in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood, it was built in the Seattle Center for the 1962 World's Fair, which drew over 2.3 million visitors. Nearly 20,000 people a day used its elevators during the event. The Space Needle was once the tallest structure west of the Mississippi River, standing at 605 ft (184 m). The tower is 138 ft (42 m) wide, weighs 9,550 short tons (8,660 metric tons), and is built to withstand winds of up to 200 mph (320 km/h) and earthquakes of up to 9.0 magnitude, as strong as the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. It also has 25 lightning rods. The Space Needle features an observation deck 520 ft (160 m) above ground, providing views of the downtown Seattle skyline. Visitors can reach the top of the Space Needle by elevators that travel at 10 mph (16 km/h), completing the ascent in 41 seconds (they are slowed to 5 mph (8.0 km/h) on windy days).<br><br>

              The Market Theater Gum Wall is a brick wall covered in used chewing gum located in an alleyway in Post Alley under Pike Place Market in Downtown Seattle.  Parts of the gum coating on the wall are several inches thick, and the coating is 15 feet (4.6 m) high along a 50-foot-long (15 m) section.The tradition began around 1993 when patrons of Unexpected Productions' Seattle Theatresports stuck gum to the wall and placed coins in the gum blobs. Some people created small works of art out of gum. It was named one of the top 5 germiest tourist attractions in 2009, second to the Blarney Stone.It is the location of the start of a ghost tour, and also a popular site with wedding photographers. The state governor, Jay Inslee, said it is his "favorite thing about Seattle you can't find anywhere else".  A scene in the 2009 Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens was shot at the wall.<br>
